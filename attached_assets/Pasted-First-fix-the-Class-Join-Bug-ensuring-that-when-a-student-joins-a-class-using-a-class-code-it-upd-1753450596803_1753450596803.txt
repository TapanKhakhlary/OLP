First, fix the Class Join Bug, ensuring that when a student joins a class using a class code, it updates both the backend database and reflects immediately in the student’s “My Classes” section on the frontend. Second, revamp the Assignment Creation interface for teachers to resemble Google Classroom, including fields for title, instructions, file uploads (supporting multiple formats, YouTube links, and cloud drive-style uploads), due date, and topic categorization. Third, address the Parent Signup Connection by automatically generating a unique student code upon profile creation, displaying it on the student’s profile, and enabling parents to link accounts using this code to access relevant student data. Implement Google Sign-In using Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth to allow secure OAuth login across students, teachers, and parents, and incorporate robust Forgot Password functionality that sends a reset link via email, leading to a secure password update form.

Next, enable Live Class Integration, allowing only teachers to initiate sessions via Jitsi Meet, Zoom SDK, or similar tools, with students receiving a “Join Live Class” button when a session is active. Ensure complete System Integration so all key entities—Teacher, Student, and Parent—are interlinked, and that classes, assignments, and submissions communicate seamlessly. Notifications must be triggered for important events like assignment creation, live session starts, and submissions. For students, build a Google Classroom-style Assignment Submission interface where they can upload multiple file formats, leave comments, submit or resubmit assignments, and view clear status updates. Also, add Profile Picture Customization for all users, allowing them to upload avatars stored in Supabase Storage or S3, with a consistent UI for profile photos throughout the app.

All components should be interconnected logically and visually consistent, maintaining intuitive user flows, clear feedback messages, and error states. Prioritize responsive design and clean UI/UX principles inspired by Google Classroom to ensure ease of use, especially around assignments, submissions, and live class sessions.
