Please implement and fix the following features to align the platform experience closely with Google Classroom standards:

1. 🛠️ Class Join Bug Fix
Issue: When a student joins a class using a class code, it doesn’t reflect in "My Classes".

Action: Debug and fix this. Ensure that joining a class updates both the backend (DB) and frontend (UI) under the student’s account.

2. 📝 Assignment Creation (Teacher)
Goal: Make the assignment creation UI and functionality similar to Google Classroom.

Include:

Title, Instructions

Upload options (files, YouTube link, Google Drive-style uploads)

Due Date, Topic/Categorization

3. 👪 Parent Signup Connection
Issue: Parent signup requires a child's code, but no such code is generated in the student profile.

Fix:

Generate a unique child code on student profile creation.

Show this code in the student’s profile view.

Allow parents to link using this code and fetch the relevant student’s data.

4. 🔐 Google Sign-In
Feature: Add Google OAuth login.

Applies To: Students, Teachers, and Parents.

Note: Use Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth (whichever you're using) to implement secure login and session management.

5. 🔑 Forgot Password Workflow
Feature: When users click "Forgot Password", provide them with a way to reset their password.

Expected Behavior: Send an email with a secure reset link (like Google), and let them enter a new password from a secure reset form.

6. 🎥 Live Class Integration
Goal: Enable live classes for teachers similar to Google Meet.

Implementation:

Embed video conferencing (Jitsi Meet, Daily.co, Zoom SDK, or Google Meet if possible)

Only teachers can start sessions

Students get "Join Live Class" button in the class dashboard when session is live

7. 🔗 System Integration
Instruction: Ensure all parts are fully connected.

Teacher ↔ Student ↔ Parent

Class ↔ Assignment ↔ Submissions

Notifications for all major actions (assignment added, live class started, submission made, etc.)

8. 📤 Assignment Submission (Student)
Goal: Make submission UI like Google Classroom.

Include:

Upload files (multiple formats)

Add comments for the teacher

Submit and Resubmit options

View assigned & submitted status clearly

9. 🖼️ Profile Picture Customization
Feature: Allow all users (student, teacher, parent) to upload or change profile pictures.

Requirement:

Default avatar + Upload option

Save to cloud (Supabase storage or S3)

Use consistent avatar UI across the app

✅ Final Note:
Ensure all systems are interconnected properly.

Maintain user feedback and error states.

UI/UX should closely resemble Google Classroom, especially in key workflows like assignments, submissions, and live classes.
